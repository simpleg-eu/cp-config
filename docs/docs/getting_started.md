# Getting started

1. In order to be able to run all the tests correctly, you must have the `SECRETS_MANAGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` populated with
   an access token with access to the development environment.
2. `microconfig`, which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/microconfig/microconfig/releases), must be
   installed in a directory located within the `PATH` environment variable.
